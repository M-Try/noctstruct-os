Autorun is a functionality included in Noctstruct
and allows you to quickly and easily start programs
on startup.

Using the autorun_edit program you can add entries
to the autorun folder located at
/etc/autorun/autorun/
These entries can be either scripts or a
".pl"-file containing the path to the program in
question. 

ex:
"autorun_edit enable SomeEntry.lua" will enable
autostart for "SomeEntry.lua", if the file exists.

"autorun_edit disable SomeEntry.lua" will disable
autostart for "SomeEntry.lua", if the file exists.

"autorun_edit add scripts/SomeScript.lua" will copy
"scripts/SomeScript.lua" and add it as an entry.

"autorun_edit add_link scripts/SomeScript.lua" will
add a file with a link to "disk/SomeScript.lua" as
an entry called "SomeScript.lua.pl"

"autorun_edit remove SomeEntry.lua" will remove
"SomeEntry.lua" or "SomeEntry.lua.pl". This only
removes entries that have been disabled. 

Newly added entries will be disabled at first, so
make sure to enable them after you added them.
Adding links is not advised when working with
disks, as it can cause problems if the disk has
been removed.
