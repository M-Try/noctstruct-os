Noctstruct is an OS running on top of CraftOS.
It augments the structure of the filesystem and
aims to make building complex and big programs
easier and make usage of the computer as a system
more intuitive and comfortable.

Folder Disambiguation:

The "os" folder contains important files and
information for and about Noctstruct itself.

The "etc" folder contains programs and services
that belong to the system and usually arent
intended to interact with the user directly.
It also contains the "autorun" folder.

The "cfg" folder is made to inhabit configuration
files and relevant system settings.
